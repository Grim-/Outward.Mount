Mount Mod 1.1.0 Change Log (Aka the changes I remember)


 ### Mod Information / Mechanics

- Dismount/Revert Form are both now bound to whatever key you use for interacting.

- Bag is gone, replaced by letting the player access their stash this is a much more stable method, this has the benefit of allowing you to access the same storage from any mount, there will be a config option to enable/disable access to the player stash.



### Mounts

- Added Pearl Bird, Black Pearl Bird, Alpha Coral Horn, Coral Horn Doe, Manticore, Alpha Tuanosaur, Tuanosaur, Beast Golem, Beast Golem Alternate(Boss model), Obsidian Elemental, Beetle from the base game as mounts. 

Special thanks goes to @Proboina for making this possible by bringing up the idea and then asking ninedots for the prefabs I would need! 
Ofcourse big thanks to ninedots, Gheyoom brought this up with their team and the lead designer Devo was happy to share his work!

This request started with asking for a single Coral Horn prefab and we ended up with 11(!) prefabs from ninedots they went above and beyond I'd just like to acknowledge that.

#### Coloring

- All of the Outward Base Game mount models can now be re-tinted, this does not look so great on some as others so this is disabled by default (but you can force any color you want on any of them more on that later).

- There are 9 different varities of 'color berries' these will be bought from the stable masters in any city for X silver (the berry that resets to default color will be free)

Special thanks to @Schnabeldoktor another fellow modder who graciously did the icons for these berries, something I am utterly incapable at.

#### Quests

Certain creatures can now drop eggs and infact thats the only way to get certain mounts.

These eggs will give you a quest to wait 12 hours then the egg hatches, you cannot hatch more than one species of egg at a time, this only applies to certain species not all of them. (Pearl Bird, Manticore, Tuanosaur)


If you have a Pearl Bird Egg quest you won't get another until that one is complete, if it is a Pearl Bird egg then there is a chance it will spawn with a different color (Yellow, Blue, Red, Green, Black, and Gold) and some of you might even be ancient enough to get the reference.
